This program is written in C#, and is meant to be run on Unity v. 2018.3.11f1. 
The code concerned with importing data from OpenStreetMap is located in the file location below. 
  real-world-map-data-master/real-world-map-data-master/src/Real World Map Data/Assests/Scripts/Editor/Open Map Importer

While in Unity, you import the code through Windows>Import OpenMap Data

1. This is how the user interfaces with ImportMapDataEditorWindow.cs. It takes in the OpenStreetMap data in .txt format, and the user's selected Materials for 
buildings and roads. 

2. From here, ImportMapWrappers.cs accesses the above class and passes the data on to MapReader.cs to read the .txt file from OSM. 

3. MapReader.cs then takes the file and defines ways and nodes for the program, and other such data that various classes can more easily understand. This info 
is then returned back to ImportMapWrappers.cs. 

4. ImportMapWrappers.cs then calls BuildingMaker.cs and RoadMaker.cs. These two are both based off  BaseInfrastructureMaker.cs, and so inherit it's methods, such as
CreateObject(), adnd DetectIntersection(). 

5. BuildingMaker.cs renders in buildings, and RoadMaker.cs renders in the roads. 

Additionally, in Real World Map Data/Assests/ there exists a car, and in Real World Map Data/Assests/Scripts/ there is Movement.cs
6. And these allow for a car to be placed on a road in the 3d environment, and when given a prepared path to follow, it can drive that path, from flag to flag.
