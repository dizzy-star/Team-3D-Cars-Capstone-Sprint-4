Sprint 4

For this Sprint, our goal is to:
  1. Complete the intersection marker. Render a box/sign on top of all "intersections"/ road joinings
  2. Be able to render cars into the environment, and give it at start and end point.
If these are completed earlier than expected, and we have the time to do extra, we shall improve the aesthetics/cosmetics of the environment just to make it look a bit better. 

For team 3d cars, we shall meet every Tueaday and Thursay, with other occasional meeting over Discord when needed.

With our Client, we shall meet up with Prof. Li every Thursay at 10 am.
